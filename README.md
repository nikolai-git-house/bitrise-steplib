## Contribution

If you find something missing from the steps, you can drop us an issue, or [create your own step](http://devcenter.bitrise.io/docs/step-dev).

### Install Bitrise CLI

It's recommended to install the [Bitrise CLI](https://www.bitrise.io/cli) on your machine so you can test your step locally.

You can install it via Homebrew:

`brew install bitrise`

Or check the latest release with instructions at: [https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/releases](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/releases)

### Share your step

After implementing your own step, you can share it with other Bitrisers using this StepLib via [`stepman`](https://github.com/bitrise-io/stepman).

If you are ready, just run `stepman share` and follow the instructions.
