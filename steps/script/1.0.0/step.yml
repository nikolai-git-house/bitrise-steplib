  Specify the script content and (optionally) the script runner
  binary and this step will execute it.

  The *runner* can even be a command, if it's available in the PATH
  and can execute the script it will work.

  For example to run a [Go](https://golang.org/) Hello World "script"
  you can define the content:

      package main
      import "fmt"
      func main() {
          fmt.Println("hello world")
      }

  Set the *Execute with* parameter to `go run` and specify
  a *script file path* because `go run` can only accept (at the moment)
  files with a .go extension (just specify `step.go` as the script path).

  If the `go` binary can be found in the PATH your Hello World
  script will run without any problem.

      **Make sure that it returns a non zero exit code in case of an error!**
      The step will only fail if your script returns with a non zero exit code!

      The executor to be used for running the script.
      If it's available in the PATH you can just
      specify `ruby` or `python`, generally
      if you know the path of the executor you should
      define that, like `/bin/bash`.

      You can even specify an execution command
      like `go run` instead of just a binary.

      Save the specified script content to this path
      before execution. The file will be removed after
      the script finishes.

      Generally you don't have to define this but
      there might be cases where the file's name or path
      actually matters.
      For example `go run` only accepts `.go` files.

      If you specify a relative path then it will be
      relative to the *working directory* (which you
      can optinally specify as well).
