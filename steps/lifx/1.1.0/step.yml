title: LIFX
summary: Lets you get visual feedback while building, using your LIFX bulb.
description: |-
  Every time you want your bulb to change color, you need to add this step.

  For example:
  You can add the step at the beginning and at the end of your work flow, to signal beginning and end (with optional color depending on success or failure of your build).
  Alternately you could just add the step at the end of your work flow, and thus just signal success or failure.
